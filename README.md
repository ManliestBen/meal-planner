# Meal Planner App
## 
## 
## Objective:  
### - Create an app that allows a user to plan meals out for a week.
## 
## 
## 
## The app can be found [here](https://deployedproject.com)
## 
## 
## Motivation:
### I've used several meal planning apps, but each of the ones I've used is missing one key piece of functionality that I'm looking for.  Some of them have great recipe search engines, but don't allow a user to save meals, some of them allow a user to set meals for each day, but only allow custom recipes, and some don't allow a place to view nutritional information.  My motivation for this project is to design an app that takes the best elements of apps I've used in the past and combine them into one that I'll WANT to use on a weekly basis.

## Prototype View:
### Here is my ERD for the data to be stored in my database:
